"Good" Data --> Normal inputs that are expected.

Test Case 1:
Checking whether the Start, Stop, and Reset buttons work.
Expected Output: Start button should start the stopwatch, ticking every 10 milliseconds and updating,
stop button should stop the timer and PAUSE it. Reset button should reset everything to 0.
Output: It works as intended.

--------------------

"Bad" Data --> Data that tries to make the program fail:

Test Case 2:
First running the stopwatch, then clicking the RESET button without stopping first.
Expected output: the program should reset the timer to 0 but not stop or break, but instead
continue running.
Output: the expected output.

Test Case 3:
Pressing start multiple times.
Expected output: the program should just ignore the next several times the stopwatch runs and not
speed up the timer.
Output: Initially, the timer would speed up, so I added code in to fix that using a global boolean to
check whether the timer was already running or not. Now it works as expected.

Test Case 4:
Pressing the Stop Button without starting anything.
Expected output: Nothing should happen (no errors).
Output: as expected.
